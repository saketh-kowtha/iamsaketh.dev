## Development Notes

### Testing PWA Features

1. **Local Testing:**
   - Use `npm run build && npm run preview` to test the production build
   - PWA features only work over HTTPS or localhost

2. **Service Worker:**
   - Clear service worker cache in DevTools > Application > Service Workers
   - Click "Update" to force service worker refresh

3. **Manifest:**
   - Validate at: https://manifest-validator.appspot.com/
   - Test icons at: https://www.pwabuilder.com/

### Adding New Icons

Create PNG versions for better compatibility:
```bash
# Generate icons from SVG
# 192x192 for Android
# 512x512 for splash screens
# 180x180 for iOS (apple-touch-icon)
```

Place icons in `/public/` directory and update manifest.json.

### Updating the Service Worker

When updating the service worker:
1. Change the `CACHE_NAME` version in `/public/sw.js`
2. Users will automatically get the update
3. Test the update flow in DevTools

## Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Firefox (Full support)
- ‚úÖ Safari iOS 11.3+ (Limited support, no install prompt)
- ‚úÖ Safari macOS (Add to Dock)
- ‚ùå IE11 (Not supported, graceful fallback)

## Security

## Performance Impact
